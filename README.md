# odin-landing-page

The second project in the Foundations track of The Odin Project. HTML and CSS are used with flexbox.


## Intro
This is the web [layout](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png), which I tried and replicated for the project requirement.

It is a very basic site built using flexbox. The main goal was to learn to structure the web layout in a way that's efficient. Coupled with CSS to style and adjust the existing layout to appeal aesthetically.

## Things I learned
1. How to start a web layout without staring at the screen for unhealthy amount of time - (Sketch)
2. Order of execution - 
    2.1 HTML boilerplate -> Sectioning -> Arranging the elements inside the sections -> (Inspect elements to make sure the elements are correctly placed)
    2.2 CSS: get the resources ready (images, fonts, color schemes, etc.) -> add foundational style (*, body, and other most used items) -> section wise style (width-height, display types, etc.) -> individual element styles (font level customization)

*Doing this project exposed me to number of challenges*
1. Time management - overall
2. Layout decisions - (sectioning and subsectioning the container elements)
3. Finding resources (images, fonts, colors)

## Difficult Areas
1. Containing the image within a div (the header svg image)
2. Figuring out the padding, margin, and sizes for the div, and container elements seem very unintuitive. (Maybe it's something that I will get used to in time, or will find out if there were some informal guidelines on the usage)

## Areas for Further Exploration
1. Digital design principles
2. Effective time management for layout (hands-on) generation without any libraries or frameworks.
3. Build a resource portfolio to my arsenal of tools

## Stats
*Target*:   3 hours
*Actual*:   4 hours 30 minutes

_NOTE: Time it took to update the README.md is excluded: 26 minutes_
